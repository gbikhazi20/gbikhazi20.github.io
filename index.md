Hello there.

My name is George Bikhazi and I'm a student at Northeastern University.

Welcome to my blog!

I've wanted to start a blog for a while, and I was finally motivated to do so as part of an assignment for a writing class I'm taking. So, here we are.

For now, I plan to write on various topics in computer science, specifically in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing. Over time, however, I'd like to delve into other subjects.
